    This work proposes a simple and efficient semi-supervised semantic segmentation algorithm that enforces consistency between a dual-branch network using online-generated pseudo-labels. This approach achieves excellent semi-supervised performance without the need for threshold-based filtering. It significantly outperforms other contemporary semi-supervised segmentation algorithms on the PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, including Google's PseudoSeg (ICLR 2021). The method has become a key baseline in the field of semi-supervised segmentation. The paper has garnered over 1,000 citations and was featured on the [<a href="https://gist.github.com/sergicastellasape/185f72fece3bb489f79366908594504d" target="_blank">list of highly-cited AI papers in 2021</a>].
