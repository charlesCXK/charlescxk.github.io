      I am currently a researcher at &nbsp; <img src="assets/images/badges/deepseek.png" style="width: 18px;" class=""> <a href="https://www.deepseek.com/" target="_blank">DeepSeek AI</a>, focusing on multi-modal large language models.
      I am driven by the mission to push the frontiers of machine intelligence and weave it into the fabric of everyday life, ultimately augmenting human potential.
